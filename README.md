# RobotGP is a genetic programming project based on TinyGP
It features a simple programming language designed to be lightweight but has all the necessary features to generate functional programs (the grammar can be found [here](/tree/master/src/Language)).
It has the following features:
- Parametrised population generation with fair size crossover and mutation
- Evaluation interface based on ANTLR
- Pre-made evaluators for some simple benchmarks
